## Overview
Many UH Manoa students and locals have a hard time finding people with similar interests to join them in outdoor activities and hobbies. Whether it’s hiking, beach outings, surfing, or just hanging out, it’s not always easy to find partners or groups that align with specific plans or schedules.

Weekend Warrior is a platform that allows users to post their upcoming weekend plans or desired activities and connect with others interested in joining them. This app would serve as a local meetup spot for casual and activity-based connections. It will also make it easier to find activity buddies and plan for fun weekends.
