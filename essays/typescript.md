Coming into this class, I really didn’t know what to expect because I had been exposed to the Electrical Engineering department for my entire college career. So far, I like how the ICS department is more like a boot camp and training students for the workforce. For example, starting out the semester with a several hour long tutorial on JavaScript was a surprise to me.

I have prior experience with Java (ICS111 and 211), C (EE160), and Python (University of Michigan - Coursera) through some of my EE coursework and personal development, so I wasn’t completely in the dark. I believe I will get proficient with TypeScript after I get plenty of practice both in and outside of class. Practice makes perfect!

From what I saw with the W3Schools tutorial, TypeScript is very similar to JavaScript. I think TypeScript is a good language for software engineering. It builds on JavaScript by adding static typing and other features to make development safer and more manageable. While I don’t know whether I will implement it in my personal projects outside of this class, it is helpful to put it under my belt as a language I could use.

The practice WODs are very useful for me. Although I find it stressful, I believe it is beneficial for me to work under pressure either alone or as a group and think quickly so that I will be prepared for a potential interview at a high-tech company in the future.
