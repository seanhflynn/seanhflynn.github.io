Coding standards might seem like small details but they actually make a huge difference in writing clean, easy-to-read code. 
When everyone follows a consistent style, it’s a lot easier to understand, especially when working with a team. Instead of wasting time trying to decipher someone’s unique style of coding, everyone can focus on solving the actual problems. 
Also, following these standards forces you to write more organized code, helping you to become a more reliable developer.

When I first started using ESLint in VSCode, it was pretty troublesome. The tool kept pointing out things like extra spaces or little formatting issues, and I felt like I was spending more time fixing errors than actually coding. 
But when I got somewhat used to it, I realized how important ESLint is. It improves my code quality but also makes my overall experience smoother. ESLint helps you write better and more consistent code by showing mistakes or things that could cause trouble later. You can get instant feedback while writing. It will make your code cleaner and easier to work with others.

In conclusion, ESLint can catch both stylistic and logical mistakes that could make your code break. This forces you to thoroughly understand the code you’re writing. 
By following these standards, you will become a more skilled and thoughtful programmer, making it easier to solve any problems that you might encounter.
