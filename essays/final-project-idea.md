## Project: Weekend Warrior
Authors: Sean Flynn, Min Jun Han, Joshua Omori, Mhar Olipani, and Nigel Arias

## Overview

The Problem: Many UH Manoa students and locals have a hard time finding people with similar interests to join them in outdoor activities and hobbies. Whether it’s hiking, beach outings, surfing, or just hanging out, it’s not always easy to find partners or groups that align with specific plans or schedules.

The Solution: Weekend Warrior is a platform that allows users to post their upcoming weekend plans or desired activities and connect with others interested in joining. This app would serve as a local meetup spot for casual, activity-based connections, making it easier to find activity buddies and plan for fun weekends.

## Approach

Once a user sets up a profile, they can post their weekend or upcoming activity plans, tagging it with details like location, time, and activity type (ex. hiking, beach volleyball, surfing, study group, etc). Others can then browse or search these posts to find activities they’d like to join, filtering by location, activity type, and schedule.

Users can also set notifications to get alerts for activities they’re interested in or when new plans are posted by specific people they’ve connected with before. Admins can monitor content, ensure the safety of the app, and add new categories for activities as they grow in popularity.

## Mockup Page Ideas

- Landing Page: An inviting page with a warm, social vibe, introducing the app and showing examples of recent or popular activities.
- User Home Page: A personalized feed of upcoming activities and plans based on the user’s chosen interests and past activities.
- User Profile Page: A place for users to describe their hobbies, list preferred activities, and provide a general schedule (like “Weekends Free,” “Weekday Mornings Only”).
- Activity Post Page: Where users can post their upcoming plans with details like time, location, activity type, expected group size, and a short description.
- Search/Browse Activities: A page where users can filter activities by type, time, location, and other parameters, making it easy to find something to join.

## Use Case Ideas

Creating an Activity: A user logs in, goes to the Activity Post Page, and creates a post for a Saturday morning hike, adding relevant tags and details.
Finding a Partner for Surfing: A user logs in, goes to the Browse Activities page, filters for “surfing” on “Sunday,” and finds a post by another user looking for a surfing buddy.
Joining an Activity: The user clicks on an activity they’re interested in, checks out the other users who’ve RSVP’d, and clicks to join or message the organizer.
Hosting Regular Events: A user who often organizes volleyball games can set up a recurring event, allowing others to easily RSVP each week.

## Beyond the Basics

Group Chats: Once a user joins an activity, they could be added to a temporary group chat with other participants, making it easier to coordinate.
Buddy Matches: For users who have overlapping schedules and interests, suggest potential buddies based on their activity history.
Leaderboard and Rewards: Users earn points for posting or joining activities, which could be redeemed for small rewards or badges to incentivize engagement.
